Authentication: Refers to proving correct identity -> Who you are ?
Authorization: Refers to allowing a certain action -> What you can do ?

<Basic Authentication>
 With this method, the sender places a username:password into the request header.
 The username and password are encoded with Base64, which is an encoding technique that converts the
  username and password into a set of 64 characters to ensure safe transmission.
  
<Bearer Authentication>
It involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood
 as “give access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token allowing access to a certain resource 
 or URL and most likely is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request.

The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources:
Authorization: Bearer <token>

<API Keys>
API Keys were created as somewhat of a fix to the early authentication issues of HTTP Basic Authentication 
and other such systems. In this method, a unique generated value is assigned to each first time user, 
signifying that the user is known. When the user attempts to re-enter the system, their unique key 
(sometimes generated from their hardware combination and IP data, and other times randomly generated by 
the server which knows them) is used to prove that they’re the same user as before.
